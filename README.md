Java fundamentals/ GitHub practice. :sleepy: :sleeping:

To add/set a remote repo after installing git:
`git remote add origin <INSERT GITHUB URL>`

To check the status(branch info, what was done etc):
`git status`

To initialize the repo/folder:

`git add README.md`

To commit the file and add a message using -m:
